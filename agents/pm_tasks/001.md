I need you to develop a new feature to allow users to add and modify categories in the LocalAI Bench application.

**Goal:** To enable users to create new categories and modify existing categories, allowing for better organization and customization of benchmark tasks.

**Description:**
The application should provide a user interface for adding new categories and modifying existing ones. This includes the ability to:
*   Define a category name.
*   Provide a description for the category.
*   Set weights for different scoring criteria (time, quality, complexity, cost, memory).

The UI should allow users to easily manage categories and their associated properties.

**User Story:**
As an administrator, I want to be able to add new categories and modify existing ones so that I can organize benchmark tasks according to my specific needs and priorities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A user interface exists for creating new categories.
*   A user interface exists for modifying existing categories.
*   Users can define a category name and description.
*   Users can set weights for time, quality, complexity, cost, and memory.
*   Input validation is in place to ensure that category names are unique and weights are within acceptable ranges (0.1 to 5.0).
*   Changes to categories are persisted in the data store.
*   The UI provides feedback to the user upon successful creation or modification of a category.

**Known Impacted Files/Modules:**

*   `ui/src/routes/categories/+page.svelte`
*   `ui/src/lib/services/api.ts`
*   `app/services/category_service/routes.py`
*   `app/services/category_service/service.py`
*   `app/services/category_service/models.py`
*   `app/services/category_service/schemas.py`

**Constraints/Considerations:**

*   The implementation should be consistent with the existing UI design and coding standards.
*   The category weights should be validated to ensure they are within a reasonable range.
*   The application should handle cases where a user attempts to create a category with a name that already exists.
*   Ensure that the new functionality is accessible and usable on various desktop resolutions.
