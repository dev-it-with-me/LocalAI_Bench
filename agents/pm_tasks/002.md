I need you to refactor existing code.

**Goal:** Refactor the scoring system to be at the task level instead of the category level.

**Description:** The current scoring system calculates scores at the category level. This needs to be changed so that each task has its own scoring criteria and weights. This will involve modifying the data models, services, and UI components to reflect this change.

**User Story (if applicable):** As a project manager, I want to be able to define scoring criteria for each task so that I can have more granular control over how models are evaluated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The scoring system should be refactored to be at the task level.
*   Each task should have its own scoring criteria and weights.
*   The data models, services, and UI components should be updated to reflect this change.
*   The existing functionality of the scoring system should not be broken.
*   Unit tests should be updated to reflect the changes.

**Known Impacted Files/Modules (Optional):**

*   `app/models.py`
*   `app/services/category_service/service.py`
*   `app/services/category_service/models.py`
*   `app/services/category_service/schemas.py`
*   Frontend components related to task and category management

**Constraints/Considerations:**

*   The refactoring should be done in a way that minimizes disruption to the existing system.
*   The new scoring system should be flexible enough to accommodate different types of tasks and scoring criteria.
