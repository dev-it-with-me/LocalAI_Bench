# Task: UI Components for Task Management and API Integration

**Goal:**  
Create UI components to handle task creation along with integrating the corresponding API functionality for adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, and deleting tasks.

**Description:**  
Develop a set of UI components using Svelte 5 and TypeScript that will allow users to:  
- Create new tasks with a dedicated form.  
- Edit existing tasks through an intuitive user interface.  
- Delete tasks with confirmation prompts.  
These UI components will consume and interact with the FastAPI endpoints defined in `app/services/task_service/routes.py` and use the API service functions in `ui/src/lib/services/api.ts`.  
Additionally, ensure the UI design adheres to our component design and state management patterns (using $state, $derived, etc.) and uses structured logging in API calls.

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want to interact with a dedicated Task Management interface so that I can easily create, update, and delete tasks through a modern UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] A dedicated page or component exists for creating, editing, and deleting tasks.  
- [ ] The task creation form captures all necessary fields (name, description, category, template, etc.) and validates inputs.  
- [ ] Editing a task pre-populates the form with existing data and saves updates via a PATCH API call.  
- [ ] Deleting a task removes it from the list after user confirmation and calls the DELETE API endpoint.  
- [ ] UI components use Svelte 5 runes for state management and responsive layouts.  
- [ ] Structured logging and error handling are implemented during API interactions.  
- [ ] The feature adheres to existing design conventions and integrates with the current API and state management systems.

**Known Impacted Files/Modules:**  
- `/home/devit/dev/LocalAI_Bench/ui/src/routes/tasks/+page.svelte`
- `/home/devit/dev/LocalAI_Bench/ui/src/lib/services/api.ts`
- `/home/devit/dev/LocalAI_Bench/app/services/task_service/routes.py`

**Constraints/Considerations:**  
- Ensure backwards compatibility with the current task listing UI.  
- Minimize additional API calls and maintain performance.  
- Follow the existing code style and logging conventions.
