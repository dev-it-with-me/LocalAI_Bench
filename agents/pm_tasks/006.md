# Task: Create UI Components for Adding New Ollama Model

## Goal
Develop Svelte UI components to enable users to add a new Ollama model via a form interface.

## Description
Implement one or more Svelte 5 + TypeScript components for adding new Ollama models. The UI should include input fields for parameters such as model ID, host, temperature, top_p, top_k, max_tokens, stop_sequences, and any extra parameters. Incorporate form validation with appropriate error messages. The components must utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and integrate with the existing model configuration workflows.

## User Story
As an admin user, I want to add new Ollama models through an intuitive UI so that I can efficiently configure and deploy them.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new Svelte component (e.g., AddOllamaModel.svelte) is created within the designated components directory.
- The form includes input fields for:
  - Model ID
  - Host
  - Temperature
  - Top_p
  - Top_k
  - Max_tokens
  - Stop_sequences (if applicable)
  - Additional parameters (as needed)
- Each field validates user input with clear error messages.
- The UI employs reactive state management using `$state`, `$derived`, and `$effect`.
- Styling is done with Tailwind CSS and is responsive for desktop use.
- Structured logging and contextual error handling are implemented within any API submission functions.
- Unit tests cover form validation and submission logic.
- Integration points with existing backend APIs are clearly documented.

## Constraints/Considerations
- Must use Svelte 5 + TypeScript per project guidelines.
- Ensure compatibility with existing design system and state management patterns.
- Follow Tailwind CSS configuration without hardcoded colors.
- The feature must integrate seamlessly with the overall model configuration workflow.
