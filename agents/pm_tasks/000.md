### Refactor: Move API Calls to api.ts Service

*   **Task:** Refactor all API calls from Svelte components to a dedicated `api.ts` service.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Description:**  Currently, API calls are scattered throughout various Svelte components. This task involves creating a centralized `api.ts` service (or similar naming convention) to handle all API interactions.  The existing API calls within the Svelte components should be refactored to use this new service. This will improve code maintainability, testability, and reusability.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   All API calls are made through the `api.ts` service.
    *   No API calls exist directly within Svelte components (except for calls to the `api.ts` service).
    *   The `api.ts` service provides well-defined functions for each API endpoint.
    *   Error handling is implemented within the `api.ts` service and propagated to the components.
    *   The application functions correctly after the refactoring, with no loss of functionality.
    *   The `api.ts` service is well-documented.
*   **Known Impacted Files/Modules:**
    *   src/routes/+page.svelte (and all other route components)
    *   src/lib/components/\* (all components making API calls)
    *   (New file) src/lib/services/api.ts (or similar)
*   **Constraints/Considerations:**
    *   Maintain existing functionality.
    *   Implement proper error handling.
    *   Ensure the `api.ts` service is easily testable.
    *   Consider using a `fetch` within the `api.ts` service.
