I need you to refactor existing code.

**Goal:** Refactor the `+page.svelte` component in the category service by extracting elements into separate, reusable components to improve maintainability and facilitate future development.

**Description:** The `+page.svelte` component in the category service currently contains a large amount of code responsible for rendering the category management interface. This includes input forms, task lists, and various UI elements. To improve maintainability and enable easier extension of the category service, this component should be refactored by extracting logical sections into separate Svelte components. These components should then be imported and used within the `+page.svelte` component.

**User Story (if applicable):** As a developer, I want the category management interface to be composed of smaller, reusable components so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend the functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The original functionality of the category management interface in `+page.svelte` remains unchanged after the refactoring.
*   All input forms, task lists, and other significant UI elements are extracted into separate, well-named Svelte components.
*   Each new component has a clear purpose and is responsible for a specific part of the UI.
*   The `+page.svelte` component imports and uses the new components to render the category management interface.
*   The refactored code is well-documented and easy to understand.
*   The component structure follows the recommended Svelte 5 + TypeScript guidelines, including the use of runes ($state, $derived, $effect, $props).
*   The new components are placed in appropriate subdirectories within the category service.
*   Ensure that the new components use colors from tailwind.config.ts and do not hardcode colors.

**Known Impacted Files/Modules (Optional):**

*   `src/routes/categories/+page.svelte`
*   Potentially new components in `src/lib/components/categories/`

**Constraints/Considerations:**

*   The refactoring should not introduce any performance regressions.
*   The new components should be designed to be reusable in other parts of the application if possible.
*   Ensure accessibility considerations are addressed in the new components (keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader support).

**Priority:** High
