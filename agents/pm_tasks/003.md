I need you to develop a new feature: Create components for elements currently implemented in +page.svelte for each service to ease the maintenance and further development.

**Goal:** Improve the maintainability and scalability of the application by creating reusable components for each service's elements currently implemented in `+page.svelte`.

**Description:** The `+page.svelte` file contains a large amount of code for rendering elements related to different services. This makes the file difficult to maintain and update. To address this, we need to create separate, reusable components for each service. These components should encapsulate the rendering logic for their respective services, making the codebase more modular and easier to understand.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have reusable components for each service so that I can easily maintain and update the UI elements related to each service.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A new component has been created for each service (e.g., BenchmarkEngine, ModelRegistry).
*   Each component encapsulates the rendering logic for its respective service's elements in `+page.svelte`.
*   The `+page.svelte` file has been updated to use these new components.
*   All existing functionality remains unchanged.
*   The components are well-documented and easy to understand.
*   Ensure each component has proper props and events.

**Known Impacted Files/Modules (Optional):**

*   `src/routes/+page.svelte`
*   Potentially new files in `src/lib/components/` (e.g., `BenchmarkEngineComponent.svelte`, `ModelRegistryComponent.svelte`)

**Constraints/Considerations:**

*   The implementation should not introduce any performance regressions.
*   The components should be designed to be reusable and extensible.
*   Ensure proper data binding and event handling between the components and the parent page.
