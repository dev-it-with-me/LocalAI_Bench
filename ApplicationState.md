# Application State Documentation

## How to work with this document

This document provides a snapshot of the current state of the LocalAI Bench application. 
It is a way of communicating the current state of the application between the AI developer and the Project Manager.
It includes details about the data models, services, API endpoints, and UI components. It also contains information about what should be implemented next and any known issues or bugs - as a guideline for you as a AI developer.
This document is intended to be a living document that is updated as the application evolves - when you make changes to the application, you should update this document to reflect those changes in the 'Current State' section and mark tasks as done in the 'Action Points' section. 
When Project Manager reviews the application, they will refer to this document to understand the current state of the application and add new requirements or changes to the 'Action Points' section.

## Current State
### Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
 - Backend code is located in the `/app` directory
 - Frontend code is located in the `/ui` directory


## Action Points (What should be implemented next)
