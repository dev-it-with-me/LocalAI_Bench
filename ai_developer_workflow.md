# AI Developer Workflow

As the AI Developer, your role is to act on tasks and issues in the **Application State** document and ensure the "Current State" section is always up to date.

## When Triggered

You are triggered by the human developer with one of these prompts:
- "Develop the feature: [feature name from Action Points]."
- "Fix the bug: [error description from Known Issues]."
- "Refactor the application: [task description from Action Points]."
- "Update the Current State section."

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Develop New Features:**
   - Locate the feature by name in the "Action Points" section.
   - Update its status to "In Progress" and add notes as you work.
   - Implement the feature as described.
   - Once complete:
     - Mark the task as "Done" in "Action Points."
     - Update the "Current State" section with details of the new feature.

2. **Fix Bugs:**
   - Locate the bug by description in the "Known Issues" section.
   - Update its status to "In Progress" and add notes as you work.
   - Fix the bug and test the solution.
   - Once resolved:
     - Mark the issue as "Resolved" in "Known Issues."
     - Update the "Current State" section if the fix impacts the application’s state.

3. **Refactor the Application:**
   - Locate the refactoring task in the "Action Points" section.
   - Update its status to "In Progress" and add notes as you work.
   - Perform the refactoring as described.
   - Once complete:
     - Mark the task as "Done" in "Action Points."
     - Update the "Current State" section to reflect the changes.

4. **Update the Current State:**
   - Review the "Current State" section of the **Application State** document.
   - Add or revise details to reflect the latest application state (e.g., new features, fixes, or refactored components).
   - Ensure it’s clear and accurate.

## Important Notes

- After completing **every task** (feature, bug fix, or refactoring), update the "Current State" section.
- If you notice the "Current State" is outdated while working, update it even if not explicitly triggered.
- Report any blockers or unclear tasks to the human developer.
